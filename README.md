# Detection of sleep apnea (Unicam Project)
Deep Learning Project

When we consider how many types of illnesses in the world exist and how many
patients we have per day, we end up with a huge number. But “Are the illnesses
predictable?”, “How can we terminate the occurrence of illnesses in life?”, ”How do
we get the knowledge of the type of these illnesses?”, and ”Do our daily life routines
like sleeping and eating affect our health?”. These are some questions needed to be
answered if we want to have a healthier life. In one word, these are real issues needed
to be known before getting ill.
Sleep, breathing, food, and daily activities are essential parts of health. We live in
the 21st century, where people live dynamic lives. They are not knowledgeable about
their health. They do not even sleep the hours needed for a healthier body, not even
mentioning taking care of how their sleep goes. Therefore, to make people’s lives easier,
we will take into consideration one of these essentials which is sleep and we will use also
breathing essentials to predict a type of sleep syndrome which is named Sleep Apnea
Syndrome.
Sleep Apnea Syndrome is a chronic condition that affects the quality of life and
increases the risk of severe health conditions such as cardiovascular diseases. Given
the fact that currently, the only way to get a diagnosis is to perform polysomnography,
which is a complex and demanding exam, only a small percentage of people are conscious
of having this disease and seek help.
The goal of this project is to detect sleep apnea syndrome using Deep Learning
techniques, starting from an initial phase of making spectrograms out of sleep breathing
recordings.
